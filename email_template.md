Hi!

Thank you for participating in Loopring's trusted setup ceremony! We really appreciate you taking the time to do this.

Before it's your turn, please take a look at the instructions on how to participate (https://github.com/Loopring/trusted_setup/blob/master/participants.md) to make sure everything will go smoothly.

Most notably, please make sure you have the following ready:
- You have a Keybase account and have joined the 'loopringceremony' group.
- You have 250GB of free disk space.
- You have 16GB of memory (RAM or swap space).

We expect each contribution to take 24-48 hours (12-24 hours of computation on a 4 core computer, 12-24 hours of uploading/downloading data). You can visit https://loopring.org/#/ceremony to check your current position on the list of participants. This allows you to estimate when it will be your turn. If it's almost your turn we will contact you so you don't miss it!

We would also like you to send us your Telegram or WeChat username. This allows us to let you know when it's your turn quickly and enables us to help you if you run into any problems.

Thanks again!
The Loopring team
